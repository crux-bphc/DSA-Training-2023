## Implementation
Implementation problems do not rely on the knowledge of any particular data structure or algorithm. They usually involve implementing some idea or may require some observations to solve the problem. Strings are very common in implementation problems, so if you aren't familiar with C++ ```std::string```, do read up on it and get familiar with it.

## Greedy
A 'greedy' approach is one where a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal one. So at every step, we make the best choice and this leads to an overall optimal answer.
