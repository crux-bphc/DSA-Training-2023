# Two pointer
The two pointer method is a technique that can be used to solve problems naively solvable in ```O(n^2)```, in linear time.

As the name suggests, it involves using two pointers to traverse a data structure, typically an array or a linked list, by moving them in different directions or in some cases different speeds to solve a problem efficiently.
