# Prefix sums
Given an array `A` of `n` elements, prefix sums are a very powerful technique that allows you to calculate the sum of any range of elements `[l, r]` for `1 <= l <= r <= n` in `O(1)` constant time with the help of `O(n)` pre-processing.

The trick is to pre-calculate in another array `prefix`, of cumulative sums, such that for each `i` from `1 to n`, `prefix[i]` stores the sum a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i]. Then, the sum of elements in the range `[l,r]` can be easily found out as `prefix[r] - prefix[l-1]`.
