# Stacks

Stacks are one of the simplest and most elementary data structures. A stack processes data in reverse chronological order, i.e. most recent first (LIFO: last in, first out) and has a wide variety of applications. Objects are pushed on top of the stack and are also popped out from the top.

# Queues

Queues are simple, yet one of the most elementary data structures. A queue processes data in chronological order (FIFO: first in, first out) and has a wide variety of applications. Objects are pushed into the queue from the back (rear end) and are popped out from the other end (the front).
