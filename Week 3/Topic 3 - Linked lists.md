# Linked Lists

Linked lists are one of the most fundamental data structures. It is a chain of nodes with each node having data and a pointer to the next node (this can vary according to the problem though)
The head pointer points to the first node and the last element of the list points to NULL. Lists can be empty too. In that case, the head points to NULL.

Problems involving linked lists have concise and clear statements generally testing how well you can come up with a clear implementation. Another popular (yet boring) style of problem would be to implement other data structres (like stacks/queues) using linked lists.
Having a good grip on basics like traversals, deletion, insertion can help greatly.
