# Depth First Search (DFS)

DFS is a method of traversing a graph. We traverse nodes going as deep into the graph as possible, before coming back out (Similar to how one typically solves maze riddles, exploring one path to its end and then returning back to the last choice that we made and then exploring the others)

DFS is arguably the most common algorithm used in graph problems, so it is important to have a solid understanding on how it works.
